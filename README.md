# Classical Molecular Dynamics from Scratch - Neighborlists and Interaction Cutoffs
This project is a final exam project for the course "Molecular Dynamics I" held at Charles University in Prague, Czechia, in spring 2021.

The task was to implement and perform a classical MD simulation of noble gas in a box. Additionally, add a neighbor-list and interaction cutoffs to speed up the simulations. Finally, implement a radial distribution function and smooth the interaction cutoff.
